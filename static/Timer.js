*   Usage
*   -----
*    // As a constructor:
*    var myTimer = new Timer(function() {
*        // Do stuff here.
*    }, 100);
*
*    // As a replacement for setInterval
*    var myTimer = setTimer(function() {
*        // Do stuff here.
*    }, 100);

*
*
*   Pointless Explanation
*   ---------------------
*   Since JS timers (setTimeout/setInterval) are useless at adhering to their
*   specified duration, this module calculates the positive or negative drift
*   of a timer and auto-corrects it.
*
*   As an example, you write this code, and run it:
*       var prev = Date.now();
*      setInterval(function() {
*            console.log(Date.now() - prev);
*            prev = Date.now();
*        }, 50);
*
*   The chances are, what is logged will rarely be `50`, especially if other
*   operations are going on in the background on the same thread/worker.
*
*   Using this module with the following code will yeild different results:
*
*        setTimer(function(drift) {
*            console.log(Date.now() - prev, drift);
*            prev = Date.now();
*        }, 50);
*
*   What will get logged now will probably still not be `50`. However, lets
*   assume that it logs 52 the first time round. The timer will then set a
*   timeout for the next tick to be 48ms, since the first time round was
*   delayed by 2ms.
*
*   For safety's sake (remove this?) it allows a minimum timeout duration of
*   10ms.
